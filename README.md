# Counting and Plotting: Linked List vs Binary Search Tree

## Introduction
<p>In this assignment, the objective is to explore the performance contrast between two fundamental data structures: linked lists and binary search trees (BSTs). The task was to analyze and compare the efficiency of these structures in inserting and searching for elements. By implementing search algorithms and tracking the number of comparisons made, was possible to have insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, we were able to visualize it through plotted graphs, illustrating the relationship between the number of elements and comparisons in each structure. </p>
